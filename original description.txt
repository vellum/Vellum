AUTHENTICALLY DIGITAL
Vellum is an authentically digital drawing app. Its tools leave aliased marks, evoking a sense of digital grit.

JUST THE BASICS
There are no knobs and dials to turn. There are no colors. There is no gallery. I believe that having fewer things between you and the page deepens one's drawing experience. These tools -- Scribble, Graphite, Shade, Line, Smudge, and Erase -- feel natural, responsive, and powerful.

DESIGN
Vellum's flat, minimal design lets the UI recede into the background and puts your focus on your drawing.

RETINA RESOLUTION
This app is optimized for Retina displays. New iPad, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, and iPhone 5 all have luxurious double resolution canvases to work within. Images will be exported at full resolution as follows:

iPad 3 / 1536 x 2048
iPhone 5 / 640 x 1536
iPhone 4 & 4S / 640 x 960

Non-retina drawings are exported at 1.5x native resolution:
iPad 2 & iPad Mini / 1152 x 1536
