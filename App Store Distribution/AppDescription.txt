AUTHENTICALLY DIGITAL
Vellum is an authentically digital drawing app for people who love to draw. Or are learning to draw. Its tools leave aliased marks, evoking a sense of digital grit.

JUST THE BASICS
There are no knobs and dials to turn. There are no colors. There is no gallery. We believe that fewer things between you and the page mean a deeper drawing experience. Our tools -- Scribble, Shade, Outline, Ink, and Erase -- *feel* like natural drawing media.

RETINA
This app is optimized for Retina displays. New iPad, iPhone 4, iPhone 4S, and iPhone 5 all have luxurious double resolution canvases to work within.
